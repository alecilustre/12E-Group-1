  <h2>Markdown Calculator</h2>
  <p>
    
  Markdown is a decrease of the item cost, basing on the failure to sell it at the underlying cost or unique selling cost. In other words, markdown is the distinction between the original retail price and the actual selling price. This app was made to calculate the markdown price.
<p>
Original selling price: the initial price, which is subject to the markdown.
<p>
Actual selling price: the price of the product after introducing the markdown.
<p>
Markdown: the value that corresponds to the price reduction of a particular product, from the customer perspective, it is the amount of money saved when buying the product.
<p>
Markdown percent: it is the percentage lowering of the price of your product.
